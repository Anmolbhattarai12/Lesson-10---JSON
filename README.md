This project is the Lesson 10 lab where we worked with JSON and JavaScript.

I updated the original files provided in class by making these changes:

Added two new flavours to the JSON file

Added calories and type fields to each flavour

Updated the JavaScript so it reads the new data and shows it on the page

Made sure the images and JSON paths match the project structure

The project is hosted using GitHub Pages.
